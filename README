Eli Allen
531 Project 2


=================================================================================================================================================================
Implementation Choices
=================================================================================================================================================================
-	Language
	For this project I used Java because of my familiarity with the language and because it comes built-in with all of the data structures I needed. 

-	Data Structures

	> Node
		- Linked list of Nodes for all of the node’s children (adjacent/successor nodes)
	    - 2-dimensional integer array for game board values

	> A* Search
		- Priority queue to keep track of the queue, or open set
		- A hashset of for the visited nodes (closed set)
		- The keys in the hashset are string representations of a board state
		- A hashmap to keep track of which goal states I’ve already generated. This was useful for calculating my heuristics. Because I had this hash map, I could reuse the coordinates of a goal state for a value after I generated it once.
	> Local Search
		- Integer array for the return value in the form [steps, nodes, solution]
			- steps represents the number of steps taken in an attempt
			- nodes represents the number of nodes generated in an attempt
			- solution is 1 if a solution was found, and 0 otherwise
		- Hashmap to keep track of previously generated goal states; this is the same as the hashmap I used in A*. 

=================================================================================================================================================================
Representation
=================================================================================================================================================================

-	Game board
		- The game board is a 2-dimensional array of integers.
		- A valid state is any arrangement of the numbers that is made possible only by swapping the blank spot with an adjacent spot (but not in a diagonal) 
		- the goal state is in the form: 
			{1, 2, 3},
			{4, 5, 6}, 
			{7, 8, 0} 	Where 0 represents the blank space.

=================================================================================================================================================================
Heuristics
=================================================================================================================================================================

-	In addition to the required Manhattan Distance and Misplaced Tiles heuristics, I chose to implement the Tiles out of Rows and Columns heuristic
	- This heuristic function counts the number of tiles that are not in the correct rows and not in the correct columns. It is admissible

=================================================================================================================================================================
Results
=================================================================================================================================================================

-	A* search
	I found that of the three heuristics I tested, Manhattan Distance performed the best, and Misplaced tiles performed the worst. This is in terms of expanded nodes and time (since they are related). 

-	Local Search
	For test runs of up to 100000 random states, Steepest-Ascent Hill-Climbing and First-Choice Hill-Climbing perform roughly the same. In general, Steepest-Ascent checks about 5 fewer nodes, so it is slightly better in terms of memory, but the time taken to complete is nearly identical. 

	Random-Restart Hill-Climbing always found a solution, but expanded many more nodes than A*. 

Comparison of A* and Steepest Ascent for 500 random nodes:

			  |-------------------------------|
		      | A* Search   | Steepest Ascent |
--------------|-------------|-----------------|
Miliseconds   |18577		|20213			  |
--------------|-------------|-----------------|
Nodes Expanded|637.97		|9930.276		  |
on average	  |				|				  |
--------------|-------------|-----------------|	

The running time is similar, but A* performs much better in memory. 
Also note that Random-Restart isn't optimal; it just picks the first solution it finds.  

=================================================================================================================================================================
Known Bugs:
=================================================================================================================================================================

-	A*
		> The misplaced tiles heuristic performs more slowly than it probably should. This is probably due to the inefficient means by which I expand nodes (and generate their children). 
		> You will likely run out of memory if you try too many random starting states in one execution of the program
-	Local Search
		> If you try to generate something like 1 million starting states to test, you will probably run out of memory and have to restart your computer
		> The results of steepest ascent and first-choice are eerily similar. I'm not sure if this is correct or not. 



Local search: I only completed steepest ascent, so the other two cases aren’t implemented.
